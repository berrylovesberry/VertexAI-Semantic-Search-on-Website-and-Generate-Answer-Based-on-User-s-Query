# vertex-ai-semantic-search-and-generate

This project enables semantic search and question answering on website content using Google Cloud Vertex AI Search, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The system leverages Vertex AI to crawl and index content from specific websites defined in a custom data store. It retrieves the top 5 most relevant webpages. And the extracted content is further processed through chunking and passed to an LLM to generate grounded, intelligent responses via a custom frontend.
