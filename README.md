# VertexAI-Website-Semantic-Search-and-Generate

This project enables semantic search and question answering on website content using Google Cloud Vertex AI Custome Search, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Streamlit. The system leverages Vertex AI to crawl and index content from specific websites defined in a custom data store. It retrieves the top 5 most relevant webpages. And the extracted content is further processed through chunking and passed to an LLM to generate grounded, intelligent responses via a custom frontend.
